This project is a superhero-themed virtual assistant that helps with tasks, reminders, trivia, and motivation. When you start, you can pick a superhero to assist you. Each hero has their own personality and background that changes when you select them. There is a task manager where you can add tasks and mark them as done when completed. There is also a reminder system that lets you set a reminder, and after a set time, an alert will pop up to remind you. The superhero trivia feature shares fun facts about the hero you selected, and the motivation button gives quotes from your hero to keep you inspired. The project also includes voice features, where the selected hero speaks their greeting and reads out trivia, reminders, and motivation quotes. There is a dark and light mode option so the user can switch between themes. For Spider-Man, there is a special animation where he swings across the screen when selected. The Joker has a surprise laugh sound effect that plays when he is chosen.The design is simple, with a background that changes based on the superhero picked. The code uses JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to make everything work together. This project uses JavaScript to create an interactive superhero assistant. Functions like chooseAssistant() change the background, play sounds, and make the assistant speak, while speak() uses the Web Speech API for text to speech.
Event listeners handle user interactions, such as selecting a superhero, adding tasks, and setting reminders. The cloneNode() method efficiently duplicates task elements instead of creating them manually. Animations, like Spider-Man swinging across the screen, are done using @keyframes in CSS and triggered by JavaScript. The dark/light mode feature switches styles with classList.toggle().
The project also uses setTimeout() for reminders and document.createElement() to dynamically add or remove elements like tasks and trivia messages. In the future, this project could be improved by making the superhero voices sound more realistic. For example, Batman’s voice could be deeper, and Iron Man’s could have a robotic filter.
